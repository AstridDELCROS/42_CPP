#### Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
- Turn-in directory : ex 00 /
- Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
- You think you know integers and floating-point numbers. How cute. Until today, every number you used in your code was basically either an integer or a floating-point number, or any of their variants (short, char, long, double, and so forth). After reading the article above, itâ€™s safe to assume that integers and floating-point numbers have opposite characteristics. But today, things will change. You are going to discover a new and awesome number type: **fixed-point numbers**! Forever missing from the scalar types of most languages, fixed-point numbers offer a valuable balance between performance, accuracy, range and precision. That explains why fixed-point numbers are particularly applicable to computer graphics, sound processing or scientific programming, just to name a few.
- As C++ lacks fixed-point numbers, youâ€™re going to add them.
- Create a class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents a fixed-point number:
```
- Private members:
â—¦ An integer to store the fixed-point number value.
â—¦ A static constant integer to store the number of fractional bits. Its value will always be the integer literal 8.
- Public members:
â—¦ A default constructor that initializes the fixed-point number value to 0.
â—¦ A copy constructor.
â—¦ A copy assignment operator overload.
â—¦ A destructor.
â—¦ A member function int getRawBits( void ) const; that returns the raw value of the fixed-point value.
â—¦ A member function void setRawBits( int const raw ); that sets the raw value of the fixed-point number.
```
Running this code:
```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
    Fixed a;
    Fixed b( a );
    Fixed c;
    c = b;
    std::cout << a.getRawBits() << std::endl;
    std::cout << b.getRawBits() << std::endl;
    std::cout << c.getRawBits() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Should output something similar to:
```
$> ./a.out
Default constructor called
Copy constructor called
Copy assignment operator called // <-- This line may be missing depending on your implementation
getRawBits member function called
Default constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
getRawBits member function called

#### Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
- Turn-in directory : ex 01 /
- Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
- Allowed functions: roundf (from <cmath>)
- The previous exercise was a good start but our class is pretty useless. It can only represent the value 0.0.
- Add the following public constructors and public member functions to your class:
```
- A constructor that takes a **constant integer** as a parameter. It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
- A constructor that takes a **constant floating-point number** as a parameter. It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
- A member functionfloat toFloat( void ) const; that converts the fixed-point value to a floating-point value.
- A member functionint toInt( void ) const; that converts the fixed-point value to an integer value.
```
And add the following function to the Fixed class files:
```
An overload of the insertion (Â«) operator that inserts a floating-point representation of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as parameter.
```
Running this code:
```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
    Fixed a;
    Fixed const b( 10 );
    Fixed const c( 42.42f );
    Fixed const d( b );
    a = Fixed( 1234.4321f );
    std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;
    std::cout << "b is " << b << std::endl;
    std::cout << "c is " << c << std::endl;
    std::cout << "d is " << d << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a is " << a.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "b is " << b.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "c is " << c.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "d is " << d.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Should output something similar to:
```
$> ./a.out
Default constructor called
Int constructor called
Float constructor called
Copy constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
Float constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
Destructor called
a is 1234.
b is 10
c is 42.
d is 10
a is 1234 as integer
b is 10 as integer
c is 42 as integer
d is 10 as integer

#### Exercise 02: Now weâ€™re talking
- Turn-in directory : ex 02 /
- Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
- Allowed functions :roundf (from <cmath>)
- Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:
```
- The 6 comparison operators:>,<,>=,<=,==and!=.
- The 4 arithmetic operators:+,-,*, and/.
- The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and post-decrement) operators, that will increase or decrease the fixed-point value from the smallest representable __ such as1 + _ >_ 1.
```
Add these four public overloaded member functions to your class:
```
- A static member function min that takes as parameters two references on fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
- A static member function min that takes as parameters two references to **constant** fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
- A static member function max that takes as parameters two references on fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.
- A static member function max that takes as parameters two references to **constant** fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.
```
Itâ€™s up to you to test every feature of your class. However, running the code below:
```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
    Fixed a;
    Fixed const b( Fixed( 5.05f ) * Fixed( 2 ) );
    std::cout << a << std::endl;
    std::cout << ++a << std::endl;
    std::cout << a << std::endl;
    std::cout << a++ << std::endl;
    std::cout << a << std::endl;
    std::cout << b << std::endl;
    std::cout << Fixed::max( a, b ) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Should output something like (for greater readability, the constructor/destructor messages are removed in the example below):
```
$> ./a.out
0
0.
0.
0.
0.
10.
10.
$>
```
